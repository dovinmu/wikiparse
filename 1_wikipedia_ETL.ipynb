    "Wikipedia allows you to download the entirety of its contents. For English only (and without talk pages) that comes out to about 16 GB of data in the zipped format. We're only interested in articles with coordinates specified for the article itself (rather than something the article refers to). So we need to 1) be able to read in a page, given either a page ID or the page's title, and 2) query all pages with coordinates with a certain display type.\n",

    "Wikipedia provides an index file to go with the database dump, that lets you read articles in batches of 100 using byte locations. But I'd rather have the exact index to all the pages; that will save time when we're iterating over a subset of the pages later. And compared to other things I'm doing, building my own index isn't terribly computationally expensive.\n",
