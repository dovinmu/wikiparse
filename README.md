## installing
The trickiest thing is installing geopandas. You'll need GDAL + Fiona before that works, get those binaries [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#fiona) and [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#gdal). The order of operations for install is GDAL, Fiona, then geopandas.
